## Option 2: Go to management with recipes

| 1. ¬†Clears up any confusion or lies quickly                                                                     | 1.  If management liked the mentee  I would be in an unpopular position with the company                                       |
| 2. If I am taken seriously, I will get credit for work                                                          | 2. A good management team would be more involved and aware of the work of each dev and wouldn't misattribute credit like this. |
| 3. ¬†Could move the mentee to another person or transition the mentee to a role they would be more successful in | 3. mentee could get fired                                                                                                      |

Script:

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Me: Hey manager, I hear my mentee is being praised for work on project X. Here is a list of pr's and commits to the project. It will demonstrate that roughly 75% of the commits were done by me and the 25% that mentees did were of poor quality. I want what is best for this team, so please take this into account when considering who gets assigned to similar projects in the future and our performance reviews.

| 1. I'll likely get paid more at my next job              | 1. Not making an effort to improve others                                                              |
| 2. ¬†Easy out                                             | 2. If I was communicating the mentee's performance poorly I won't learn how to do better in the future |
| 3. ¬†¬†Don't have to deal with a non-communicative manager |                                                                                                        |

  

Script:

  

¬† ¬† Me: Hey manager, I've been communicating to you that my mentee is not meeting expectations, but now they are being praised for the work I completed for them. If this is untrue please correct me, but I don't feel like my input was taken seriously, and am now considering my options.

1Ô∏è‚É£ st Principle:

- when you've done all you can, it is fine to leave a bad situation as it is

  

# Excursus 

Injustice and misunderstandings like these have always bothered me more than most other situations. Even during a show or a movie I will skip a scene when someone is credited to work they didn't do, or when an innocent person is accused falsely. 

Knowing myself, I would be dismayed to be in a situation like this. If it were within my capabilities I would be continually communicating to my managers the struggles that this dev is having. It would also behoove my manager to be actively involved in the work and projects in our project so they should be very aware of the quality of code that each dev contributes. 
  
  

# My Choice

Honestly, if I had been kind, but vocal about this dev and this still happens I would just quit. If I am put in place to mentor someone and the person that gave me that role is entirely divorced from that point on then I can make more money as a real software engineer somewhere else rather than being a weird developer babysitter.
