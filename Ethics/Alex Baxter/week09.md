| 1. Trust in God's sovereignty                                             | 1. lack of an immediate fix could be harmful if they try to use the system on Sunday             |
| 2. Following God's example and design for us                             | 2. While this is a principled move it doesn't glorify God in doing good work that points to him. |
| 3. Follow the letter of God's law which was designed for our flourishing | 3. Hard to justify this choice to team members who don't agree with values.                     |

Script:

    Me: Hey all, I spotted a bug on Saturday and as of this morning it is entirely resolved. I did some quick work to make sure that users were not affected by it on Saturday night when I first spotted it. 

üìñ Scripture

>"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day _is_ the Sabbath of the LORD your God. _In it_ you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who _is_ within your gates. For _in_ six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that _is_ in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it."  **[Exodus 20:8-11](https://www.bibletools.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/bible.show/sVerseID/2060/eVerseID/2063)**  

  

1Ô∏è‚É£ st Principle:

- God's commandments to us are designed for us to flourish so we should follow them
## Option 2: Fix the bug that night

| 1. Seeks the quickest solution                                                                   | 1. Takes away from family time on Saturday and might be groggy on Sunday                                                         |
| 2. Even if we end up working a little late into Sunday we still have most of the sabbath to rest | 2. If I am unable to fix the bug that night then I not only have worked into the sabbath but I haven't resolved the problem |
| 3. No one is affected by the bug I introduced.                                                   |                                                                                                                                |

Script:

    Me: Hey team, I had to pull a late night when I spotted a pretty serious bug. Seems like everything is working as expected now. 

üìñ Scripture

>"On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and he prolonged his speech until midnight. "**[Acts 20:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+20%3A7&version=ESV)** 

  

1Ô∏è‚É£ st Principle:

-  It's not bad to pull a late night every once in a while when people will be helped because of it.

## Option 1:  Just work on Sunday if necessary

| 1. The project will have a thorough fix.                                         | 1. missing a large part of having a restful day                |
| 2. I won't be thinking about this issue after I fix it                            | 2.  Going against my personal goal of not working on a Sunday. |
| 3. Through being diligent and working hard I am pointing other people to Christ. |                                                             |
| 4. I am not breaking any law from the NT                                         |                                                                |
| 5. I am taking imitate responsibility for the mistake I made                     |                                                                |

Script:

    Me: I realized I introduced a serious bug, but it is resolved now. I don't normally work on Sunday but this was sort of an extraordinary circumstance. 

üìñ Scripture

>"The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath." **[Mark 2: 27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+2%3A+27&version=NIV)**

>also **[Matthew 12:1-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+12%3A1-13&version=NIV)**

  

1Ô∏è‚É£ st Principle:

- Doing good things on the sabbath isn't bad. Misunderstanding is what led the Pharisees to condemn Jesus for healing people on the Sabbath. 
# Excursus 

The answer to this question is reliant upon what project I am working on. There is a big difference between a serious bug in an application that turns a .mp4 into a .gif and a project that is used in an incubator that regulates the heartbeat of an infant. 
# My Choice

The urgency of my response depends heavily on the severity of the bug and what its implications are for the lives of the users. If I believe God will be more glorified in doing more work, even if it is on the sabbath then that is what I  believe I should do. The reason I would rest is because it would magnify the goodness of God. If I work, it is because it would magnify the goodness of God. 

As John Piper points out in his book "Don't Waste Your Life" there were times when Moses, David, Jerimiah, Jesus, and Paul left situations without solving all of their issues, and there were times when all of these men stood their ground and did difficult thing even until the point of death. What was important is that they sought to magnify God in both their leaving and staying.
