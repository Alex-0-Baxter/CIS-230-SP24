# <span style='color: Orange;'>Excursus </span>
The biggest issue in this circumstance is the deadline. There is a solution that exists, It is just a matter of when it is implemented. Assessing motives and communicating are very important skills to develop in the workplace and relationships.


# <span style='color: Orange;'>My Choice</span>
The clear choice to me is to thoroughly assess the motivations of why the deadline is set. There is a large difference between being motivated by a national security threat or an arbitrary deadline set by a large bureaucracy. Understanding the reason for the perceived urgency will. Starting the project this way allows for clearer boundaries for the scope of the project, and may help to find a solution that solves the same problem without difficulty.
