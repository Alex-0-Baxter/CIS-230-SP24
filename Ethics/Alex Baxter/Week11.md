# <span style='color: Orange;'>Excursus </span>
The biggest issue in this circumastance is the deadline. Clearly there is a soulution that exits, It is just a matter of when it implmented. Assessing motives and communicating clearly are very important skills to develop in the workplace and in relationships.


# <span style='color: Orange;'>My Choice</span>
The clear choice to me is to thouroghly acesss the motivations of why the deadline is set. There is a large difference between being morivated by a national security threat or an abitrary deadline set by a large buracracy. Understanding the reason for the presived urgancey will. Starting the project this way allows for clearer boundaries for the scope of the project, and may help to find a soultuion that solves the same problem without the difficulty.
