How to tithe and, more broadly, how to work the Old Testament laws into the lives of Christians in the new covenant have been issues of discussion for roughly 2000 years. This issue becomes especially complicated when you see a violation of the old covenant as a consequence of doing work for your church.

I would most likely approach my pastor and just ask him what his thoughts on how to tithe are and figure out what his circumstances are. A better understanding of covenant theology has recently convicted me that we should view each of the covenants in the bible as expanding of the covenants of grace. I now believe that you should generally try to keep a sabbath and tithe because they are moral laws in the Old Testament. It is important, even for a pastor, to be in submission to God. Money is one of the many ways God can bless us and we need to use money understanding that it is God‚Äôs and we are stewarding it for now. I hold the position that even if it is not to your church directly; you generally should give 10% or more of your earnings to something that reminds you that your resources are God‚Äôs and you are in submission to him.
