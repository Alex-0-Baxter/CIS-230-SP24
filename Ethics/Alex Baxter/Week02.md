While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to a project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
  

---

## Option 1: Tell the customer that their expectations are unreasonable

üëç Pros:

1. Prevent Most Job loss

2.  If the client keeps us then their expectations for the project would be more reasonable

3. The company would likely be more agile if it kept more employees

4. demonstrates an understanding of the client's needs 

üëé Cons:

1. likely to create a more confrontational relationship with the client

2.  Might lose the client entirely

Script:

    Me: We are training your ML but its implementation is complex and will need to be checked and corrected. You will need to keep some staff to do this.
    Client: We will take this into account When we make staffing decisions.

## Option 2: Try to convivence the customer to use a transition plan for the employees

üëç Pros:

2. utilizes all available talent 

3. Provide an opportunity for employees to future-proof their resumes with skills that will be more useful. 

üëé Cons:

2. Could be overstepping boundaries as a contractor

Script:

    Me: have you considered allowing the employees you plan on letting go to transition to another role at the company? Your company has been successful so far thanks to their hard work and they are already accommodated to working on your team.
    Client: We can look into that. I could see some situations where that might work well.

üëç Pros:

1.  Simplicity

2. Employees can find a company that will treat them better

3.  If the company over-hired then the company will be an appropriate size for everyone's work to be meaningful.

üëé Cons:

1. Maximal job loss

2. The clients may be unhappy when they discover they overcorrected and need people to continue to rain the ML model as the world changes. 

Script:

    Me: We understand that implementing new technology can bring necessary change to a company and we are glad to help you become more efficient, however; have you thought of a way to minimize the harm caused by mass layoffs in this transition
    client: Our goals for this year require some difficult decisions. We are not excited about it either but if the rest of the company is supposed to do well then we need to make hard decisions.

# Excursus

Losing your job can be gut-wrenching. I can remember the stress and the pain my family went through when my dad lost his job. It would be ideal to minimize that pain. It is also good to provide people opportunities to grow and change, build other skills, and contribute meaningfully to a project. 

The world is constantly changing. This is especially true of emerging technology. Improving technology has led to fewer blacksmiths more machines, and less carriage drivers, and more cars. This isn't bad forever. The world changes and people adjust and the world becomes an easier place to be.

It is also the case that people overstate the impact a new technology may have on the world. This exuberance can lead people, and overzealous managers to be too eager to hit aggressive targets motivated by hopes and dreams. There is a delicate balancing act between all of these factors and choices like these affect many' people's mental state and home life.


  

# My Choice

OPTION 2: I would encourage my client to establish a way for employees who to transition from one role to another. I would also encourage them to let the employees know in advance so they have time to update their resumes and start looking while they still have a steady income. Working with emerging technology is good and there will be growing pains but people are resilient. I believe this middle-of-the-road approach both honor God in doing good work and loving others by giving them agency and information to choose whatever is the best choice to make for themselves.
