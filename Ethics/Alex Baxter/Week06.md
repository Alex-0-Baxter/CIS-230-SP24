# Week 6 Prompt 
 Looking back on the first 5 week's prompts, choose the one that resonated with you most. 
 Pick two other students in class and read their options and their choices. 
 In this week's essay, summarize each of those responses with a simple bullet list in your own file and then pretend THEIR CHOICES are the only choices you have (don't go back and revisit your essay for the prompt). 
 Given their choices only, which would YOU choose? Do you agree with the authors? Explain why or why not.

|1.  Tell the Customer about the full human cost of their decision. This is all an effort to be considerate and transparent.|1. Don't rock the boat. Things like ML's eventual takeover of the workforce are not directly related to sin issues so I might as well make the people I work with happy.|
|2. Offer alternatives that may impact fewer people. Even if it creates more hurdles for the project it is worth it to take care of your fellow man.|2. Make the customer consider their decision and the impact it has on others. The employer may have been acting single-mindedly.|

# My Choice

While all of these options are well thought out, I am most engaged by Even's whistleblower idea. While I will admit it is cowardly I believe it provides the best balance of honoring God through doing good work and loving your neighbor by delivering valuable information that impacts their lives. 

This is especially true if  I leak information in an area that is highly visible to the employees of the company. The employees could start getting resumes and cover letters ready on time for their departure from the company.

The major issue with this option is the implicit or explicit lies I would have to tell to my employer. It is generally a breach of trust and contract to release sensitive internal data like this. It may still result in being fired.

I think the benefits outweigh the costs of this choice. I would feel like a cool spy man and be doing a thing that helps others so it's a win-win.
