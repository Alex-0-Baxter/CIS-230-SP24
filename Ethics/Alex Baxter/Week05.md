# Excursus (I cant get enough either)
Academic Dishonesty?? More like academic WACK-honesty. (Because you'd have to be wack to do it.)

A college degree, upon graduation, is supposed to communicate something deeply meaningful. It says that you are a person who can persevere and do difficult things for a long time. This is only true because college is a difficult experience that you do have to preserve through. Cheating obfuscates that deep meaning by surpassing the perseverance portion of that period in your life. 

Flawed as we are, we often despise the things that are designed to be the best for us to do. As paul writes" I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do," Romans 7: 15. Included in this is the difficult work of learning diligently. 


# My Choice
Despite the uncontrollable variable I like the idea of demonstrating the reason why cheating harms the student. I would want to test their ability understand the material they cheated on to really drive home what they are missing out on when they effectively lie to themselves and the school.
