# Week 4 Prompt 
A junior engineer at your company, leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence, has completed a critical software project well ahead of schedule. The AI has written almost the entire application, raising questions about the engineer's understanding of the project's intricacies. Despite this, the company's management, impressed by the speedy delivery, is planning to integrate this AI-generated software into major systems immediately. You are concerned but you are also friends with this junior developer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Answer
## Option 1: Thourough Code Review Yourself 

|üëç Pros:| üëéCons:|
|-----|------|
|1. Will catch any possible bugs that are the AI included |1. Will slow down deployment |
|2. acting within standard practice of an SWE so Junior dev's integrity isn't in question|2. not communicating the errors caught to management will result in more AI-written code, resulting in more errors|
|3.    |3.  Junior dev's skill isn't improved|

Script:

    J dev: [project] is finished. This new AI tool I found did wonders. It should be good to push to main. 
    Me: Did you run tests or review the code thoroughly?
    J dev: Not yet. Should be fine though right?
    Me: I'll take some extra time to make sure. This project is important and should be done correctly. 

üìñ Scripture
>"Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love." Ephesians 4:2

1Ô∏è‚É£ st Principle:
- always be careful and diligent with a project you submit


## Option 2: Ask them to explain

|üëç Pros:| üëéCons:|
|-----|------|
|1. Walking you through the code will help you understand it |1. Will take even longer than a code review yourself|
|2. Teaching the code they are responsible for will help them learn |                 |
|3. will catch errors along the way                    |                 |

Script:

    J Dev: [project] is finished. This new AI tool I found did wonders. It should be good to push to main.
    Me: Nice work. Let's walk through it for a while to make sure it's good quality. You never know what AI might hallucinate in there.  

üìñ Scripture
>"Instruct the wise and they will be wiser still; teach the righteous and they will add to their learning. " Proverbs 9:9

1Ô∏è‚É£ st Principle:

## Option 3: Submit and work bugs out later


|üëç Pros:| üëéCons:|
|-----|------|
|1.FAST|1.AI code could contain crucial errors|
|2. Encourages others to use tools that may help them work faster|2. J dev might be assigned tasks they aren't at all ready for|


Script:

    J Dev: [project] is finished. This new AI tool I found did wonders. It should be good to push to main.
    Me: Sounds good. I trust that you've tested everything. Management will love this. 

üìñ Scripture
>"spur one another on toward love and good deeds" Hebrews 10:24

1Ô∏è‚É£ st Principle:
- You'll never be able to catch every error so we might as well just address them as they come up. 

# Excursus 
Development is difficult and new tools are useful in helping engineers see the potential flaws in their work and to do more work. Companies try their darndest to outcompete one another for a higher quality product. AI can both help and hinder that process. All people see on the outside is the amazing technological advances and the speed at which things improve. They don't see all the issues will laitent behaviors and hassel with hallucinations. 

# My Choice

If possible I'd love to work with the j dev to help them learn anything they don't understand in their code. Their project was completed quickly so taking the extra time available to help them would not only be beneficial to their knowledge base but we'd also catch any errors along the way.
